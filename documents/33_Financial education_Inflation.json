The amount of goods and services considered for the basket is representative of its importance in the consumption of households residing in Portugal, making its cost, therefore, representative of household spending.; The cost of this basket is usually presented as a price index: the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Every month the CPI is calculated as the average of prices of goods and services included in the basket, weighted by their share in the basket.; With the CPI as a basis, the following rates are calculated:; Annual rate of inflation – change in the CPI between the current month and the same month of the previous year. It is used to measure developments in inflation from the same period a year earlier. For example, a 3% year-on-year inflation rate in April means that prices have increased by 3% compared to April in the previous year;\nMonthly inflation rate — change in the CPI between the current month and the previous month (month-on-month change). It is used to measure inflation every month.  For instance, a 0.5% monthly inflation rate in April means prices have risen by 0.5% compared to March of that year;\nAverage inflation rate — average rate of change in the CPI in the past 12 months vis-à-vis the previous 12 months. It is used to measure inflation for the year as a whole. For example, a 4% inflation rate means that, on average, prices in a given year were 4% higher than in the year before."}, {"id": 2, "link": "https://clientebancario.bportugal.pt/en/importance-maintaining-price-stability", "question": "The importance of maintaining price stability", "answer": "To both households and the economy, it is important that prices are stable:; \nIf inflation is high and unstable, money loses its purchasing power, and the amount of goods and services that you can buy with the same income decreases rapidly, making it hard for households and firms to plan their expenses.

This is the target decided upon to maintain price stability in the euro area, seeking to avoid prolonged periods of inflation that is too high or too low. Inflation below the 2% target is as undesirable to the ECB as inflation above target.; To assess price stability, the ECB uses the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices (HICP). The HICP follows an identical methodology in all European Union countries. In Portugal, it is calculated similarly to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and considers a basket that is representative of the consumption of households in the Portuguese territory, including spending of non-residents (such as tourists).; "}, {"id": 4, "link": "https://clientebancario.bportugal.pt/en/importance-maintaining-price-stability", "question": "The importance of maintaining price stability -> How does the ECB influence price developments?", "answer": "The ECB does not influence the prices of goods and services directly. It makes use of monetary policy instruments (for example, official interest rates) to, indirectly, influence household and corporate spending and thereby the prices of goods and services. It may take several quarters until a monetary policy decision is fully reflected in prices.; "}, {"id": 5, "link": "https://clientebancario.bportugal.pt/en/importance-maintaining-price-stability", "question": "The importance of maintaining price stability -> How do official ECB interest rates affect interest rates in the economy?", "answer": "The official interest rates are the main instrument the ECB has at its disposal to fulfil its mission of safeguarding price stability.; The official interest rates are:; the interest rates banks pay for borrowing from the ECB;\nthe interest rate the ECB pays for the deposits it receives from banks.; When the ECB raises or lowers the official interest rates, the following are affected: (i) the costs of banks with the loans obtained from the central bank, as well as (ii) the value banks receive for their deposits with the central bank. Indirectly, these changes are reflected in the Euribor (European Interbank Offered Rate) rates, which are based on the average of interest rates charged for interbank loans in euro by a group of European banks, as well as in the interest rates banks charge for credit granted to customers and the interest rates they pay for their customers’ deposits.; If the ECB judges inflation to be too low, it may lower the official interest rates to induce a reduction in the economy’s interest rates with the aim of stimulating consumption and investment and raise inflation. Conversely, if the ECB wants to reduce inflation, it may increase the official interest rates, in order to decelerate consumption and investment.; Interest rates charged by banks when granting credit to their customers are not set by the ECB. Nevertheless, by setting official interest rates, the ECB seeks to influence the other interest rates in the economy, namely interest rates applied to home loans, consumer credit or loans to firms charged by banks.; In Portugal, the most used interest rates in loans to households and firms use the Euribor rates as reference and these have different maturities (for example, 3, 6 and 12-month Euribor rates)."}, {"id": 6, "link": "https://clientebancario.bportugal.pt/en/how-inflation-affects-your-life", "question": "How inflation affects your life", "answer": "Inflation affects household budgets in multiple ways.  Inflation has a direct impact on expenses and the real value of income and savings.; High inflation leads the European Central Bank (ECB) to increase official interest rates, resulting in banks raising their interest rates and in a higher cost of credit for households.;  "}, {"id": 7, "link": "https://clientebancario.bportugal.pt/en/how-inflation-affects-your-life", "question": "How inflation affects your life -> Impact on expenses and income", "answer": "In an inflationary environment, goods and services become more expensive and the value of households’ spending tends to increase. To buy the same basket of goods and services, households must spend more money.; However, if prices for goods and services increase, households start buying a lesser quantity of goods and services with the same income. In other words, the real value (purchasing power) of income decreases.; In an inflationary context, if the increase in household income is lower than that in the prices of goods and services (inflation), their real income (purchasing power) decreases.; Inflation does not impact everyone in the same way.

This raise results in an increase in the Euribor, the reference rate for loans with a variable rate, as are most home loan agreements.; In loans with a variable rate, the interest rate results from the sum of the average value of Euribor (reference rate) with a spread fixed at the beginning of the agreement. When the Euribor rises, so do the interest rates of loans with a variable rate and, therefore the value of instalments to pay for that credit.; For households with loans with a variable rate (for example, home loans), an increase in interest rates means an increase in expenses on the monthly budget.
