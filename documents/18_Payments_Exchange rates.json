For example, the EUR/USD exchange rate of 1.5415 means that the inverse quotation, USD/EUR, corresponds to 0.6487, i.e. the inverse of 1.5415 (1/1.5415).; If USD/EUR = 0.6487, each dollar is worth less than one euro, which means that the euro is worth more than the dollar. In this case, it means that in order to obtain one US dollar, it is necessary to deliver 0.6487 euros.; "}, {"id": 3, "link": "https://clientebancario.bportugal.pt/en/exchange-rates-what-they-are", "question": "Exchange rates – what they are -> Cross quotations", "answer": "A currency may not have direct quotation in all foreign currencies. The calculation of the cross quotation makes it possible to obtain the exchange rate of a currency for which there are no published quotations.; Where two different exchange rates are available with a common currency, it is possible to calculate the cross exchange rate.; If, for example, the EUR/USD and USD/JPY values are available, the value of the EUR/JPY can be calculated as follows:; EUR/USD = 1.5326 means that 1 EUR = 1.5326 USD; USD/JPY = 105.33 means that 1 USD = 105.33 JPY; Hence, EUR 1 = 1.5326 x (JPY 105.33) i.e. 1 EUR = JPY 161.43. Hence, we get the quotation EUR/JPY = 161.43."}, {"id": 4, "link": "https://clientebancario.bportugal.pt/en/bid-offer-spread", "question": "Bid – offer ‘spread’", "answer": "In the market, the exchange rate always presupposes two quotations: one for selling (bid) and one for buying (offer) the base currency.\nFor the credit institution (or other authorised agent):\n\nThe bid exchange rate is the price it charges to sell the foreign currency;\n\nThe offer exchange rate reflects the price that this institution accepts to pay for the foreign currency.\n\n\nIn the case of the institution, the selling rate is always higher than the buying rate.\nFor bank customers:\n\n\nThe exchange rate to buy the foreign currency corresponds to the bank’s selling price (bid);\n\n\nThe exchange rate to sell the foreign currency corresponds to the bank’s buying price (offer).\n\n\nIn the case of customers, the selling rate is always lower than the buying rate.; By convention, the bid exchange rates are presented to bank customers to the left of the offer exchange rates (for example, EUR/USD quotation of 1.5326/1.5328).\nCustomers always sell the base currency at the lowest value and always buy at the highest value.; The difference between bid and offer rates is not the same for all currency pairs. Usually, there is, in percentage, a lower spread in the quotations of the most liquid currencies, i.e. those that are more transacted. The spread between the purchase price and the sale price is therefore an indicator of currency liquidity.; Example\nIf the EUR/USD quotation of 1.5326/1.5328 is shown, it means that:\n\n\nIf customers want to sell one euro, they will receive USD 1.5326 (lowest value);\n\n\nIf customers want to buy one euro, they will have to deliver USD 1.5328 (highest value).\n\n\nIf the price quoted is 1.5326/1.5328 and customers want to buy a dollar amount equivalent to 2500 euros:\n\n\nThey should choose the EUR/USD quotation on the left: EUR 1 = USD 1.5326 (selling price of the euro);\n\n\nEUR 2500 = 2500 x 1.5326 = 3831.50 USD, i.e. with the sale of 2500 euros the customer will receive USD 3831.50.; Example\nIf the EUR/GBP quotation of 0.7850/0.7852 is given, it means that:\n\n\nIf customers want to sell one euro, they will receive GBP 0.7850 (lowest value);\n\n\nIf customers want to buy one euro, they will have to deliver GBP 0.7852 (highest value).\n\n\nIf the price quoted is 0.7850/0.7852 and customers want to sell GBP 500:\n\n\nThey should choose the EUR/GBP quotation on the right: EUR 1 = GBP 0.7852 (purchase price of the euro);\n\n\nThe selling price will be GBP 1 = 1.2736 EUR (1/0.7852)\n\n\nGBP 500 = 500 x 1.2736 = EUR 636.8, i.e. with the sale of GBP 500 the client will receive EUR 636.80."}, {"id": 5, "link": "https://clientebancario.bportugal.pt/en/where-exchange-currency", "question": "Where to exchange currency", "answer": "In Portugal, currency can be exchanged at banks and exchange offices registered with Banco de Portugal.\nThe currency exchange service is free, meaning the institutions are not required to exchange foreign currency.; The exchange rates to be applied are freely set by the entities authorised to carry out the currency exchange activity. These entities must advertise their purchase and sale prices.\nFees charged to customers by the currency exchange are also freely set and must be included in the institutions’ price lists. In cases where fees are not charged for the currency exchange, these costs may be implicit in the exchange rates set by the institution.; Banco de Portugal does not exchange foreign currency.\nThe exchange rates published by Banco de Portugal are benchmark exchange rates defined by the European Central Bank (with the exception of the exchange rates of the Macao pataca and the Cape Verde escudo, which are defined by Banco de Portugal).\nBenchmark exchange rates are only informative and do not distinguish between buying and selling prices."}]}
