In this case, the interest is counted as of the date of issuance of the monthly statement, in the event that the customer does not repay all of the amounts owed;\n\n\nCards without a free-float period – cards that, in at least one payment modality, do not allow the use of interest-free credit. In this case, the interest on the amounts that are not paid on the agreed date will be counted from the moment the card is used."}]}
