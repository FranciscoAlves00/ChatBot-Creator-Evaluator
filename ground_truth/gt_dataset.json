        "question": "What are the implications of the deposit guarantee scheme on my savings?",
        "answer": "The deposit guarantee scheme ensures that your savings deposited in a bank are protected. Regardless of the type of deposit, the bank must ensure the reimbursement of the total amount deposited at maturity or on the date allowed for early mobilization if permitted. In case of insolvency, deposits are protected up to a maximum amount of 100,000 euros per credit institution and depositor, whether the depositors reside in Portugal or not. The guarantee covers all deposits (except those excluded by law), regardless of their interest rate. The interest earned on deposits is also included in the balances covered by the guarantee.",

        "question": "Can you explain the different types of consumer credit available?",
        "answer": "Consumer credit is designed for the purchase of goods and services such as cars, appliances, education, and health services. It includes personal credit (for various purposes), car credit (for car purchases), credit cards, overdraft facilities, and credit overruns. However, this type of credit is not guaranteed by a mortgage or other equivalent guarantee on real estate.\n\nConsumer credit can be provided in traditional formats with a set amount, term, and repayment method (like personal loans and car loans). Alternatively, it can be offered as revolving credit with a defined maximum credit limit and an indefinite term. This is common with products like credit cards, lines of credit, and overdraft facilities.\n\nIt's important to note that different types of consumer credits have different characteristics and associated costs. Therefore choosing the most suitable type of credit is crucial as there are significant differences in conditions and costs among them.",

        "question": "How do I manage debt effectively, especially with rising interest rates?",
        "answer": "If you're having difficulties paying your housing loan due to increased interest rates, you can contact your credit institution and inform them about the degradation of your financial capacity. The institution is then obliged to develop actions as per the action plan for risk of non-compliance (PARI). You should cooperate with the credit institution by providing requested documents and information. If there's a confirmed risk of non-compliance and they conclude that you have financial capacity, institutions must present proposals to renegotiate the loan within 15 days after you've provided the requested information and documents.\n\nThe proposals for renegotiation can include changing one or more conditions of the credit contract such as extending the repayment term of the loan, setting a grace period for capital repayment or capital and interest payment, deferring part of the capital to be repaid in a future installment, or temporarily reducing the applicable interest rate on the contract. They may also propose consolidating several existing credit contracts in your name and signing a new credit contract aimed at refinancing debt from an existing credit contract.",

        "answer": "Sure, here are the steps to transfer a mortgage loan to another bank:\n\n1. Notify your current bank: You can transfer your loan to another credit institution at any time during the contract's term. However, you need to notify your current bank about this intention 10 days in advance.\n2. Pay off the existing loan: To transfer the loan from one institution (A) to another (B), you will have to make an early total repayment of the loan.\n3. Understand potential charges: Your current bank may charge a prepayment commission, which cannot exceed 0.5% of the repaid capital for contracts with variable interest rates or 2% for contracts with fixed interest rates. Until December 31, 2024, customers are exempt from paying this commission on housing credit contracts for purchasing or building their own permanent home with a variable interest rate.\n4. Transfer information: After requesting the loan transfer, your current bank must provide all necessary information and elements for granting the new loan to the new institution within 10 working days.",

        "answer": "The Central Credit Register (Central de Responsabilidades de Cr√©dito) provides information about the type and status of your credit, the amounts owed, and the terms of your loans. Negative information in the Central Credit Register could lead to a credit institution contacting you to assess signs of risk of non-compliance. This could potentially affect your creditworthiness as it might indicate a degradation of your financial capacity. If you adhere to certain measures like temporary fixation of housing loan installment, it will result in an automatic marking in the Central Credit Register as 'renegotiation'. This marking will be visible to institutions when evaluating their new credit operations.",
