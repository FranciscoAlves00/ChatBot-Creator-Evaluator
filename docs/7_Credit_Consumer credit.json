They may also involve leasing operations.\nThere are several types of car loans:\n\n\nCar loan subject to the retention of the ownership: this is a car loan in which, in order to guarantee the repayment of the loan until the end of the agreement, a right on the car is registered (reservation of ownership) with the competent conservatory;\n\n\nCar loan not subject to the retention of theownership: this is a car loan where there is no reservation of ownership. The institution may require other guarantees, such as a personal guarantee, for example;\n\n\nFinancial leasing: this is a financing modality through which the credit institution (lessor) grants the customer (lessee) the temporary use of a car, in exchange for the payment of a monthly rent. At the end of the agreement, the customer will be able to purchase the car, if interested, by paying the amount defined in the agreement (residual value);\n\n\nLong-term rental: this is a modality in which the credit institution temporarily grants the use of a car to the customer, through the payment of a monthly rent. When the contract is entered into, the customer agrees to purchase the car at the end of the rental.\n\n\nThe renting agreement (or Operational Leasing) is not considered a loan, nor is it contracted by a credit institution. It corresponds to the rental of vehicles on the payment of a monthly rent and generally has an associated set of services (such as car maintenance or tyre replacement services).\n"}, {"id": 3, "link": "https://clientebancario.bportugal.pt/en/what-it-and-types-credit", "question_topic": "What it is and types of credit -> Revolving credit", "answer": "\nRevolving credit is an agreement in which a ceiling is established that can be used over time and re-used as the outstanding balance is being repaid.

The repayment of the amount used occurs according to the modality agreed with the institution;\n\n\nOverdraft facility: this is a credit agreement that allows customers to have funds that exceed the balance of their current account, up to a maximum credit limit defined in the agreement. There are different types of overdraft facility agreements, depending on whether or not they involve the domiciliation of salary in the associated current account and depending on whether the repayment term of the credit amount used is equal to or less than one month or more one month;\n\n\nCredit line: this is an agreement of indefinite duration, in which a maximum credit limit is established and in which, as a rule, the credit is made available in the customer’s account;\n\n\nBank credit account: this is a fixed-term agreement, in which there is no fixed timetable for repayment and in which a maximum credit limit is established.\n\n\n"}, {"id": 4, "link": "https://clientebancario.bportugal.pt/en/what-it-and-types-credit", "question_topic": "What it is and types of credit -> Credit overrun", "answer": "\nA credit overrun is an overdraft that is tacitly accepted by the institution and allows customers to have funds that exceed the balance of their current account or the ceiling agreed for the overdraft facility.\nThe possibility of overrunning must be provided in the agreement of the current account or in the agreement in the form of an overdraft facility.\nIf the credit overrun is significant and lasts for longer than one month, the customer must be informed of this overrun, the amount exceeded, the nominal rate and any applicable penalties, charges or interest for late payment.\nThe credit institution may not charge fees for credit overruns.\n"}, {"id": 5, "link": "https://clientebancario.bportugal.pt/en/what-it-and-types-credit", "question_topic": "What it is and types of credit -> Debt conversion agreement", "answer": "\nThe debt conversion agreement is a credit agreement entered into between the credit institution and a bank customer in default of a previous credit agreement with the aim of renegotiating the contractual conditions, in the sense of deferring payment of the debt or changing the mode of the repayment of the debt.\nWhen debt conversion agreements make it possible to prevent a legal action for non-compliance and the customer is not subject to less favourable terms than those of the previous credit agreement, only certain specific rules of the consumer credit scheme apply.\n"}, {"id": 6, "link": "https://clientebancario.bportugal.pt/en/how-enter-consumer-credit-agreement", "question": "How to enter into a consumer credit agreement", "answer": "Before entering into a consumer credit agreement, bank customers should evaluate the impact of the monthly instalment on the family budget and compare different credit options.; It is important for bank customers to provide true and complete information to the financial institution and to clearly state the purpose of the credit they intend to borrow.
