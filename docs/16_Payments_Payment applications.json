The payment app may grant access to the current account and allow operations to be made from that account, similarly to home banking, or it may only allow a few specific operations.\nA third-party provider. In this case, the payment app is operated by an entity that is not the customer’s payment service provider. The user accesses the payment app and links a current account or a payment card through which the funds are moved (this is the case, for instance, of the payment apps MBWay, Apple Pay, Google Pay, Garmin Pay, Fitbit Pay and Swatch Pay). Even if the payment app is operated by a third-party provider, ultimate responsibility for the correct execution of payment transactions made through the app lies with the customer’s payment service provider (as is the case with payment apps offered by the customer’s payment service provider)."}, {"id": 1, "link": "https://clientebancario.bportugal.pt/en/transaction-costs", "question": "Transaction costs", "answer": "Payment service providers may charge fees for transferring money through payment applications (payment apps).

Not all apps are safe: some may contain malicious software;\nCarefully analyse the payment apps’ reviews. Many reviews are fake, created to mislead the user into installing the respective payment app. When in doubt, contact your payment service provider beforehand;\nCheck the data access permissions required by payment apps. Do not download apps if the permissions required seem excessive;\nCheck, on the payment service provider’s website, the information about the app you wish to download and follow the configuration instructions given;\nCreate a password to access the app that is difficult for third parties to appropriate. Do not use passwords that are too obvious, such as 123456, or associated with easily obtainable personal information, as are birth dates or names;\nRefrain from sharing the payment app password or transaction authentication codes with third parties. If the device allows it, favour biometric authentication elements (for example, fingerprint or facial recognition), which third parties are unable to appropriate;\nVerify which authentication elements are solicited in each access to the payment app and be suspicious of requests for additional information;\nRead all the information provided in the notifications carefully before authorising the transaction;\nEnsure the payment app password and other authentication elements are entered somewhere offering some degree of privacy;\nMake sure the session was ended correctly after using the payment app and that it is necessary to login to access it again;\nAdd only your phone number when signing up to a payment app (the MBWay app, for example);\nContact the payment service provider immediately if you receive a notification about an unfamiliar transaction;\nReport to the payment service provider, as soon as possible, the loss, theft or misappropriation of the payment card or of the payment app’s access credentials;\nCancel the payment app or deactivate/remove the account/payment card from the stolen/lost device, in case of theft or loss of the mobile device (smartphone, tablet or smartwatch) in which the payment app is installed."}]}
