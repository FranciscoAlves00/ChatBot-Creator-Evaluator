Should the payers not be consumers or micro-enterprises, the ISO 20022 XML message format must be used when communicating with payment service providers to send batch transfers.\nThe countries that make up the SEPA area are:\n\nthe 27 European Union Member States – Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden;\nIceland, Liechtenstein and Norway (countries which, along with the aforementioned, constitute the European Economic Area);\nAndorra, Monaco, San Marino, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and Vatican.\n\nThe sender (or the beneficiary) of the credit transfer may not require that the payment account of the beneficiary (or the sender) be situated in a particular Member State.\n"}, {"id": 3, "link": "https://clientebancario.bportugal.pt/en/transfers-what-they-are", "question_topic": "Transfers – what they are -> Instant and standard transfers", "answer": "\nIt is possible in Portugal to make standard credit transfers and instant transfers.\nWhen the user makes a standard transfer, the funds are available on the day on which the payment order is received – in the case of transfers between accounts domiciled with the same payment service provider – or by the end of the following business day – in the case of transfers between accounts domiciled with different payment service providers.\nWhen the user makes an instant transfer, the funds are available in the (private or corporate) beneficiary’s account within at most 10 seconds, irrespective of the date and time in which the transaction takes place, up to a maximum of €100,000 per transaction.\n \n\n \nIn the case of instant transfers:\n\n\nThe transferred funds are available in the beneficiary’s accounts a few seconds after the payment order is sent. The success of the transaction is confirmed to the payer and the beneficiary. The maximum time for carrying out the transfer is 10 seconds. In other words, the amount must be available in the beneficiary’s account less than 10 seconds after the initiation of the payment order by the payer’s payment service provider. Where this is not achieved, if the transaction is not completed within 20 seconds, the system will reject the operation and the payment service provider must notify the payer;\n\n\nTransfers up to €100,000 (per operation) are possible, as standard across the EU. However, the payment service providers may establish bilateral agreements allowing higher sums to be processed;\n\n\nTransfers are possible 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. For example, instant transfers may be carried out with the value arriving in the beneficiary’s account during the weekend, which does not happen in the case of standard credit transfers, with their limits on reception of the transfer order and longer time frames for executing the transaction and providing the funds.\n\n\nWith instant transfers, payments may be made between individuals or for goods and services, both in person and remotely (for example, when shopping online).\n \nPayment service providers (such as banks, payment institutions and electronic money institutions) are not required to provide instant transfers. As a result, some institutions may not provide this service.\nSince October 2020 instant transfers are possible between SEPA countries.\n \nInstant transfers are account-to-account transactions (between the payer’s and beneficiary’s accounts) and not card-based transactions, like other solutions in the market such as MBWay.\n"}, {"id": 4, "link": "https://clientebancario.bportugal.pt/en/how-order-transfers", "question": "How to order transfers ", "answer": "Credit transfers can be ordered in payment service providers' branches by completing and signing the respective form.; Most payment service providers allow credit transfers to be ordered over the phone and through their websites.; Credit transfers are distinct from ‘Multibanco transfers’ carried out via an ATM on the Multibanco network with a payment card. Transfers made through the Multibanco network are considered card-based transactions.; Instant transfers may be ordered in branches or through the various digital channels that member payment service providers make available to their customers (e.g. homebanking or smartphone app).

TARGET2 is the Eurosystem settlement system in which payment transactions between payment service providers are processed.; Other TARGET2 holidays, like other TARGET2 closing days (Saturdays and Sundays), have no impact on the credit and availability of funds in user payment accounts, since they coincide with national public holidays or bank holidays.; In non-SEPA intra-Community credit transfers made in the currencies of non-euro area Member States, the same time limits for interbank credit transfers in euro shall apply, unless otherwise agreed.
