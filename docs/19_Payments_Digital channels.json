On this fake page, customers are asked to fill in certain information fields, often with the claim that they need to update their personal data, otherwise the bank account will be blocked.\n"}, {"id": 3, "link": "https://clientebancario.bportugal.pt/en/risks-posed-digital-channels", "question": "Risks posed by digital channels -> Fraud -> Pharming", "answer": "\nThis is when a virus on a computer, tablet or smartphone redirects a link typed in by the customer to a fake web page (called a ‘mirror website’).
